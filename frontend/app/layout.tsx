/*
 * Issue #145: both faces come from next/font, which downloads them at build
 * time and serves them from this origin — no request to a font CDN at runtime,
 * and nothing for the content security policy to have to allow.
 *
 * `variable` hands the generated family to the element as a custom property
 * instead of a class, which is what lets globals.css point Tailwind's theme at
 * it (`@theme inline`). `display: "swap"` shows text in the fallback rather
 * than invisible while the font loads, and next/font's size-adjusted fallback
 * metrics keep that swap from moving anything on screen.
